## Purpose
This README explains the Aircrack-ng cheatsheet included in `aircrack-ng-cheatsheet.md`. The cheatsheet is a concise, copy-ready reference for commonly used Aircrack-ng suite commands and companion tools for wireless security testing (monitor mode, packet capture, deauth, cracking, PMKID workflows, etc.).

## Files
- `aircrack-ng-cheatsheet.md` — Main cheatsheet with commands, short explanations, and example workflows.
- `README_Cheatsheet.md` — This file (overview & how to use).

## How to use
1. Open `aircrack-ng-cheatsheet.md` in any Markdown viewer or text editor.
2. Follow the legal & ethical reminder at the top before using any tools.
3. Use commands in a controlled lab environment against networks you own or have permission to test.
4. Copy/paste commands into a terminal on Kali Linux (adjust interface names like `wlan0` to match your machine).

## Prerequisites
- Kali Linux (or another pentest distro)
- Wi‑Fi adapter that supports monitor mode & injection (recommended: Alfa series)
- Installed tools: `aircrack-ng`, `hcxdumptool`, `hcxtools`, `macchanger`, `hostapd`, `kismet` (as needed)
